{"text":"Yours respectfully and sincerely , CHRISTOPHER SETH . NEEDLES IN HAY : IS IT ART CRITICISM ? TWO QUESTIONS"}
{"text":"What is art ? Leo Tolstoy asked the question , and in 1898 his remarkable book with that title gave his reply ."}
{"text":"He underlined the need for art to communicate what the artist has felt : Is it criticism ? A REVEALING INSTANCE"}
{"text":"A famous passage of art criticism can be cited as one example entirely beyond dispute . Perhaps of all ancient pictures time has chilled it least ."}
{"text":"Then comes the peroration . Hers is the head upon which all `` ends of the world are come '' , and the eyelids are a little weary ."}
{"text":"Certainly Lady Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the old fancy , the symbol of the modern idea ."}
{"text":"Pater 's book is a classic , and easy to find in a library . Among the magazine articles , which are most likely to be interesting to her ?"}
{"text":"Will she find good reproductions of Lee Krasner 's work ? Our American friend 's cousin in London is an art student ."}
{"text":"Her college library has interesting books , as well as the latest art magazines . ART CRITICISM AND ART HISTORY"}
{"text":"Do art historians write about the past , while art critics write about the present ? And he remembered the painter :"}
{"text":"As some poets are great readers , Gorky — exceptional among painters — was a fervent scrutinizer of paintings ."}
{"text":"No interesting touch or invention of form escaped his eye . Fifty years ago they were in closer touch ."}
{"text":"If he were alive today , he would have even more cause for satisfaction . In 1933 he wrote as follows in a lecture at Cambridge University :"}
{"text":"An enormous amount of work has been done and perhaps still more remains to be done in arranging works of art in exact sequence of time ."}
{"text":"I am obliged to use the awkward and inadequate word `` Art-history '' for it . WRITINGS ON ART A RULE OF THUMB"}
{"text":"It will by now have become evident that this book takes an unorthodox approach to art criticism . Nor will a history of art criticism be attempted ."}
{"text":"To put the matter in a slightly different way , reading art criticism is a preparation for an aesthetic event ."}
{"text":"In other words , there are no aesthetic objects , only physical objects , which , when observed , are capable of stimulating an aesthetic event . ''"}
{"text":"We can return for a moment to talk to the girl who went to Italy , and was overwhelmed by Michelangelo 's Sistine Chapel ceiling ."}
{"text":"Her idea of the value of art criticism was a simple one . There was a crucial sequence . Michelangelo painted the ceiling ."}
{"text":"Critics have visited the chapel and written about it . According to this , art criticism has three indispensable elements ."}
{"text":"These are description , interpretation , and judgement . Walter Pater 's account of the Mona Lisa can be used as an example ."}
{"text":"Pater 's judgement is decisive , that this picture is Leonardo 's masterpiece . The plan of the book , then , is simple ."}
{"text":"After the first two chapters , it discusses where and how to read art criticism . So , it is to the critics themselves we turn next ."}
{"text":"AMUSING AND POETIC : THE BEST CRITICISM A FATHER OF MODERN CRITICISM Modernity also had other manifestations ."}
{"text":"The real benefit of reading Baudelaire himself on the art of his contemporaries is the chance of recovering some of the excitement the poet felt ."}
{"text":"It is an additional pleasure to recognise his prophetic power of divining where the best art was to be found ."}
{"text":"Baudelaire argued for modernity , but he also strongly believed that a critic has the right to be partisan ."}
{"text":"He asserted the plain fact of the existence of differences in taste . Which is the greatest of these great men who differ so much from one another ?"}
{"text":"He wrote : Thus the best account of a picture may well be a sonnet or an elegy… as for criticism properly so-called…"}
{"text":"THE ADVOCATE He may be taken as an example of a first type of critic , the advocate . Ruskin wrote fluently and seriously , often at length ."}
{"text":"These sites of criticism are cramping for persuasive advocacy , even if excellent use is sometimes made of them ."}
{"text":"The connections and friendships of Surrealism can also be instanced as opportunities for advocacy . THE PROGRESSIVE"}
{"text":"A second type of critic may be called the progressive . He believed that Paris was seeing a forward surge in the arts ."}
{"text":"Writing on were unaffected by French bourgeois taste . Like Apollinaire , they saw a rift between the old century and the new ."}
{"text":"Gertrude Stein later wrote a book on Picasso , in which she put the point like this : More and more the struggle to express it intensified ."}
{"text":"In its slightly earlier day , pointillism had also had a progressive artistic programme . Read was a progressive without being wholly partisan ."}
{"text":"He disobeyed Baudelaire 's instruction to be partial , or obeyed it only in so far as he took a stand against conservative taste ."}
{"text":"He did not take sides against Abstraction , even though he was one of the organisers of a Surrealist exhibition in London in 1937 ."}
{"text":"This was difficult to understand for impassioned artists who saw Surrealism and Abstraction as struggling for the soul of modern art ."}
{"text":"Read 's account of the work of Paul Klee is characteristic . ( Klee 's art ) denies the reality or sufficiency of normal perception…"}
{"text":"The eye of the artist is concentrated on his pencil ; the pencil moves and the line dreams . THE POLITICIAN"}
{"text":"A committed critic writes from a social , nationalist or political conviction , which interacts with an aesthetic response to a work of art ."}
{"text":"National or political fervour can alternatively be the motor force of remarkable artistic achievements ."}
{"text":"Among some of his frescoes there are some which are imprinted on the memory for ever . '' This is art , as Lenin wished , for the people ."}
{"text":"In the USSR itself , art flourished at first in experiments after the 1917 Revolution , but became confined to social utility after 1922 ."}
{"text":"Commentary or criticism of such art within the country concerned necessarily takes the same position ."}
{"text":"In modern China an attempt has also been made to create a national art , in this instance by partly discrediting tradition ."}
{"text":"The critical distinction between feudal dross and democratic essence subsequently proved difficult to make ."}
{"text":"In other political states during the twentieth century , there has been strong support for the view that art should serve a social purpose ."}
{"text":"Many of his readers approved his sensitive and appreciative understanding of paintings , though without sharing his political views ."}
{"text":"THE COMPILER A fourth type of critic can be called the compiler , whose criticism is implied in choices for collections or exhibitions ."}
{"text":"The compiler 's main critical medium is the catalogue , and rather less often articles or a book . THE TRADITIONALIST"}
{"text":"Some stress has been thrown thus far on modernism and its advocacy , but a traditional critic may write as well or better than a modernist ."}
{"text":"Our fifth type must therefore be the traditionalist , for whom it is a pleasure to find the past living on in the present ."}
{"text":"A traditional critic has the advantage of being able to turn to standards and values inherited from the past ."}
{"text":"The highest praise can be given to works which match up and accord with these . no great vigour of mind or strength of original genius ."}
{"text":"Reynolds was a notable conversationalist , well able to stand up to his friends , who included Samuel Johnson and Edmund Burke ."}
{"text":"It is in this more informal context that his draft for a sixteenth and ironical discourse should be read ."}
{"text":"It attacks his constant enemy , the idea of genius : Genius , as it disdains all assistance , so it defies all obstacles ."}
{"text":"The student here may inform himself whether he has been favoured by heaven with this truly divine gift ."}
{"text":"Reynolds ' weighty irony was wielded with more address than arguments put forward by later traditionalists ."}
{"text":"But his views were dismaying to one of the readers of his discourses , the poet and artist William Blake ."}
{"text":"As to genius , `` Reynolds '' opinion was that Genius may be taught & that all Pretense to Inspiration is a Lie & a Deceit , to say the least of it ."}
{"text":"For if it is a Deceit , the whole Bible is Madness . This Opinion originates with the Greeks ' calling the Muses Daughters of Memory . ''"}
{"text":"THE THEORETICIAN The last type of critic to be distinguished in the present chapter will be the theoretician ."}
{"text":"Today , theory is in high fashion at Western universities , and varied in scope . Paul Valéry wrote that a painter :"}
{"text":"Even such richness may not be enough for a theoretician . He described this aesthetic response as the bed-rock of conservative criticism ."}
{"text":"For him , critical writing has to take up wider issues than enjoyment of a picture or a sculpture . AERIAL VIEW : SURVEYS"}
{"text":"CHRONOLOGICAL SURVEYS `` The White Rabbit had put on his spectacles , but he did not know where to start ."}
{"text":"`` Begin at the beginning , '' the King said gravely , `` and go on till you come to the end : then stop. '' ?"}
{"text":"Many art books follow this plan , especially those aiming to take in a national culture or a whole civilisation ."}
{"text":"Unlike old-fashioned narrative history , art has no decisive battles , no international treaties , and no changes of government ."}
{"text":"This is perhaps a more useful analogy than might at first sight appear . Deciding where is the beginning can be a trouble for an art historian ."}
{"text":"In Europe , classical times are a beginning for historians , but not for archaeologists . A few single volumes have had deserved success ."}
{"text":"An American work on the same lines was first published in 1926 by Helen Gardner . She called it Art Through the Ages ."}
{"text":"Neither of these works , nor two more which are to be discussed , have attempted to integrate Eastern with Western art ."}
{"text":"The limitations of surveys can be demonstrated by two examples of well-respected books . There are also technical limitations ."}
{"text":"Again , the need for the deeply interested reader to supplement a survey with other books becomes evident ."}
